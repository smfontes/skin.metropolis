msgstr "Actionfilm byder ofte på høj energi, dyre stunts og jagter - muligvis med redninger, krige, kampe, flugter, destruktive kriser (oversvømmelser, eksplosioner, naturkatastrofer, ildebrande osv.), non-stop bevægelse, spektakulær rytme og fart og eventyrlystne - ofte todimensionelle - good guy helte (eller heltinder), som kæmper mod de onde - altsammen designet som rendyrket virkelighedsflugt for publikum."

msgctxt "#31344"
msgid "Adventure films are usually exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales, very similar to or often paired with the action film genre. They can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, \"jungle\" and \"desert\" epics, treasure hunts, disaster films, or searches for the unknown."
msgstr "Eventyrfilm er oftest spændende historier med nye oplevelser eller eksotiske lokaliteter og meget lig actionfilm-genren. De kan være traditionelle søheltefilm, filmserier og historiske vidundere, eftersøgninger eller ekspeditioner efter glemte kontinenter, \"jungle\" og \"ørken\" eventyr, skatterjagter, katastrofefilm eller søgen efter det ukendte."

msgstr "Action- og Eventyrfilm er i de fleste tilfælde sammenblandinger af hinanden. De har som regel et vedvarende højt energiniveau, komplicerede stunts og andre aktiviteter af samme natur. Jagter, krige, katastrofer, eksplosioner, historiske figurer, udforskninger, erobringer osv; og sidst, men ikke mindst, helte."

msgid "Animations are not a strictly-defined genre category, but rather a film technique, noted for frame-by-frame creation. This includes claymation (use of clay objects), anime (a style of animation with its roots in Japanese comic books, usually adult-oriented sci-fi and fantasy) or CGI (computer-generated animation). Animated films are often considered kid or family-oriented films, although they may be enjoyed by all ages."
msgstr "Animationer er ikke én bestemt genrekategori, men snarere en film teknik, som er skabt med det kendte frame-by-frame (billede i billede). Dette omfatter claymation (brug af ler objekter), anime (en stil af animation med rødder i japansk tegneserier, normalt voksen-orienteret sci-fi og fantasy) eller CGI (computer-genereret animation). Animerede film er ofte betragtet som børn- eller familieorienterede film, selv om de kan nydes af alle aldre."

msgctxt "#31348"
msgid "Anime, or Japanese animation, covers a much wider range of genres than can be found in most Western animation. There is anime for all age groups, and, while much of it fits into the same genres as any TV show or movie (comedy, romance, horror and action), there are several terms that are particular to anime."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "#31356"
msgid "Disaster films, a sub-genre of action films, hit their peak in the decade of the 1970s. Big-budget disaster films provided all-star casts and interlocking, Grand Hotel-type stories, with suspenseful action and impending crises in locales such as aboard imperiled airliners, trains, dirigibles, sinking or wrecked ocean-liners, or in towering burning skyscrapers, crowded stadiums or earthquake zones. Often noted for their visual and special effects, but not their acting performances."

Originally, the earliest documentaries were either short newsreels, instructional pictures, or travelogues (termed actualities) without any creative story-telling or staging. But they have branched out and taken many forms, and have sometimes become propagandistic and non-objective. Mockumentaries are comedic parodies of documentaries."

msgid "Fantasy films, usually considered a sub-genre, are most likely to overlap with the film genres of science fiction and horror, although they are distinct. Fantasies take the audience to netherworld places (or another dimension) where events are unlikely to occur in real life - they transcend the bounds of human possibility and physical laws. They often have an element of magic, myth, wonder, and the extraordinary."

msgid "Film noir (meaning 'black film') is a distinct branch of the crime/gangster sagas from the 1930s. Strictly speaking, film noir is not a genre, but rather the mood, style or tone of various American films that evolved in the 1940s. Noirs are usually black and white films with primary moods of melancholy, alienation, bleakness, disillusionment, disenchantment, pessimism, ambiguity, moral corruption, evil, guilt and paranoia. They often feature a cynical, loner hero (anti-hero) and femme fatale, in a seedy big city."

Horror films feature a wide range of styles, from the earliest silent Nosferatu classic, to today's CGI monsters and deranged humans.
